The Refined Features: 

TF-IDF Vectors: effective for highlighting significant words by looking at the frequency of a word in a document and its relevance across all documents. This helps in determining the difference between words that carry significant meaning and words like "like, and, but". 

N-grams: they capture the sequences of words, this allows the model to be able to understand the context of the text better than if it were trained on single words. This is particularly useful for things like sentiment analysis. 

Sentiment Scores: provides a quantitative score to the sentiment of a certain string of text. This is useful for giving the model an extra way of being able to differentiate between positive and negative reviews.
